ðŸŒŸ *Step-by-Step Guide:*
1. *Download MongoDB:*
   - Visit the official MongoDB website (https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/...) and download the MongoDB Community Server for macOS.

2. *Extract the Archive:*
   - Once the download is complete, locate the downloaded file (usually a .tgz or .tar.gz archive) and extract it. You can do this by double-clicking on the file or using the terminal:
     ```bash
     tar -zxvf /path/to/downloaded/mongodb-osx-ssl-x86_64-4.x.x.tgz
     ```

3. *Move MongoDB to /usr/local:*
   - Move the extracted MongoDB folder to `/usr/local` for easier access:
     ```bash
     sudo mv mongodb-osx-ssl-x86_64-4.x.x /usr/local/mongodb
     ```

4. *Create Data Directory:*
   - MongoDB requires a data directory. Create one using:
     ```bash
     sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/var/mongodb
     ```

5. *Set Permissions:*
   - Set proper permissions for the data directory:
     ```bash
     sudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/local/var/mongodb
     ```

6. *Add MongoDB Binaries to PATH:*
   - To access MongoDB from any location in the terminal, add the MongoDB binaries to your shell's PATH. If you're using Zsh, edit your Zsh configuration file (usually `~/.zshrc`):
     ```bash
     nano ~/.zshrc
     ```
     Add the following line at the end:
     ```bash
     export PATH="/usr/local/mongodb/bin:$PATH"
     ```
     Save and exit.

7. *Restart Zsh or Source the Configuration:*
   - Restart Zsh or source the updated configuration:
     ```bash
     source ~/.zshrc
     ```

8. *Start MongoDB:*
   - Start MongoDB by running:
     ```bash
     mongod --dbpath /usr/local/var/mongodb
     ```
